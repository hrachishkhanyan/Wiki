# Sorry for submitting this late. As I told during the phone interview, it has been slightly more than a year that I haven't practiced web development. It took me a while to read the documentations. I used React here, as I find it to be one of the nicest libraries there for JS. I've written the app from a scratch, because it really helped me refresh my memory, learn some new things and understand everything better. Thank you for this opportunity!
